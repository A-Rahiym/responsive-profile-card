            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I'm Aisha Muhammad, a Computer Engineering student at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. My journey in tech is fueled by a passion for solving real-world problems, inspired by Nigeria's rich cultural heritage like the Durbar festival. I believe technology can bridge the gap between tradition and innovation, creating opportunities for communities across Northern Nigeria.</p>

        <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
            <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
            <p>My goal is to master frontend development, build impactful projects, and transition into a tech entrepreneur, creating solutions for local markets. I want to develop skills in React, accessibility, and responsive design to create applications that serve African communities. By the end of this program, I aim to have a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my ability to solve real problems with elegant code.</p>

        <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>I sometimes struggle with advanced CSS layouts, particularly CSS Grid and complex Flexbox patterns. I also find optimizing JavaScript performance challenging, especially when working with large datasets or implementing efficient algorithms. Additionally, I need more practice with testing frameworks and deployment pipelines, but I'm actively working to improve through consistent practice and learning from the community.</p>

        <section data-testid="test-about-future-note">
            <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
            <p>Keep pushing forward, Aisha! Your dreams of tech hubs in the Sahel are within reach—stay curious and resilient. Remember that every expert was once a beginner, and every challenge you overcome makes you stronger. Don't be afraid to ask questions, share your knowledge, and collaborate with others. The path won't always be easy, but your determination and passion will carry you through. Celebrate small wins and never stop learning!</p>

        <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>I'd love to collaborate with others to digitize Nigerian markets and explore AI applications in education. I'm particularly interested in how machine learning can be used to preserve indigenous languages and create localized educational content. I also want to mentor young girls in my community who are interested in STEM, showing them that they too can build the future. Technology is not just about code—it's about impact, community, and creating opportunities for the next generation.</p>
